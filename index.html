                Healthy spinach leaves typically have a vibrant green color and a crisp texture.
                <ol>
                    <li>Spinach leaves should have a bright green color without any yellowing or brown spots. The color indicates that the spinach is fresh and has retained its nutrients.</li>

                    <li>
                        The leaves should be crisp and firm, not limp or wilted. This indicates that the spinach is fresh and has not been sitting on the shelf for too long.

                        No signs of decay: Check for any signs of decay, such as mold or slimy spots on the leaves. This indicates that the spinach is not fresh and may be unsafe to eat.

            Downy mildew can cause a number of visible symptoms on spinach leaves. Here are some of the common signs of downy mildew infection in spinach:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Yellowing of leaves: Downy mildew can cause yellowing of the leaves, particularly in the areas between the veins. This can progress to a general yellowing of the entire leaf.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    White or gray growth on underside of leaves: As the disease progresses, a white or gray downy growth can appear on the underside of the leaves. This is caused by the fungus producing spores.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Leaf distortion: Downy mildew can cause leaves to become distorted or curled.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Reduced plant growth: In severe cases, downy mildew can cause reduced plant growth and yield.

            Leaf spot disease is a fungal infection that can affect spinach leaves. It is caused by a number of different fungi, including Cercospora, Phoma, and Alternaria species. Here are some common signs of leaf spot disease in spinach leaves:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Small, dark spots on leaves: Leaf spot disease can cause small, dark spots to appear on the leaves of the spinach plant. These spots can vary in size and shape, but they are typically round or irregularly shaped.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Yellowing of leaves: As the disease progresses, the leaves may begin to yellow around the spots. In severe cases, the leaves can become necrotic and die.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Brown or black spots on stems: In addition to affecting the leaves, leaf spot disease can also cause brown or black spots to appear on the stems of the spinach plant.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Defoliation: In severe cases, leaf spot disease can cause significant defoliation of the plant, leading to reduced plant growth and yield.
                </li>

                <li>
                    White, powdery pustules on underside of leaves: White rust can cause the appearance of white, powdery pustules on the underside of the spinach leaves. These pustules can be small and circular, and may merge to form larger, irregular shapes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Yellowing of leaves: As the disease progresses, the leaves may begin to yellow around the white rust pustules.

                <br>
                <li>
                    Distortion of leaves: White rust can cause the leaves of the spinach plant to become distorted, curled or cupped.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>

            Leaf diseases are a major problem for farmers and can
            cause significant crop losses. Early detection of these
            diseases is crucial for preventing their spread and hence
            minimising the damage. <br><br>
            Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used for detecting diseases in leaves and even
            predict their occurrences based on the sensor data obtained
            from the IoT platform. <br><br>
            These are basically environmental parameter data. These data can be further associated with the
            machine learning models to make disease prediction based
            on various combination of environmental parameters. This
            technique can be used to automatically identify patterns in
            images that are indicative of a particular disease.
            <br><br>
            This information can then be used to provide farmers with early
            warnings about potential problems, allowing them to take
            steps to prevent or mitigate the damage. In this project we
            use Spinach as our main subject planted inside the IoT
            enabled polyhouse.
